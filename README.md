# Hospital Management System

🔗 **Live System (Deployed):**  
https://hospital-system-production.up.railway.app/

This project is a **Hospital Management System** developed using the **Django web framework**.  
It is designed to demonstrate the full implementation of **CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** in a real-world, database-driven web application.  
The system manages core hospital data through a web interface and has been successfully deployed to the cloud.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop a complete web application using Django
- Implement full **CRUD (Create / Read / Update / Delete)** functionality
- Integrate backend logic with a relational database
- Simulate basic hospital management workflows
- Deploy a fully functional system accessible online

---

## 🔁 CRUD Functionality (Core Feature)

The system fully implements CRUD operations across multiple hospital-related modules, including patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records.

### ➕ Create
- Add new patient records  
- Add doctor information  
- Create appointment records  
- Create medical / encounter records  

### 📖 Read
- View patient information  
- Browse doctor details  
- View appointment schedules  
- Access historical medical records  

### ✏️ Update
- Update patient details  
- Modify appointment information  
- Edit doctor profiles  
- Update medical record data  

### ❌ Delete
- Delete patient records  
- Cancel appointments  
- Remove incorrect or outdated data entries  

All CRUD operations are implemented through **web forms and database interactions**, and changes are reflected immediately in the system.  
For **privacy and security reasons**, some create, update, and delete operations involving sensitive data are **restricted to administrative users only**.
