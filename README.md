# Hospital Management System (MySQL-Based)

🔗 **Live System (Deployed):**  
https://hospital-system-production.up.railway.app/

This project is a **MySQL-based Hospital Management System** designed to demonstrate the practical use of a **relational database** in a real-world application.  
The core focus of the project is on **database design and CRUD operations**, with **Django used as the backend framework** to interact with the MySQL database and provide a web-based interface.

---

## 🎯 Project Focus

- Design and use a **MySQL relational database**
- Implement complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations at the database level
- Manage multiple related entities in a healthcare scenario
- Use a backend framework to safely and efficiently access database data
- Deploy a fully functional database-driven system online

---

## 🗄️ Database-Centered CRUD Functionality

All system operations are centered around the **MySQL database**, which stores and manages hospital-related data such as patients, doctors, appointments, and medical records.

### ➕ Create
- Insert new patient records into the MySQL database  
- Add doctor information to the database  
- Create appointment records  
- Store medical and encounter records  

### 📖 Read
- Query patient data from the database  
- Retrieve doctor information  
- Display appointment schedules  
- View historical medical records  

### ✏️ Update
- Update existing patient data in MySQL  
- Modify appointment details  
- Edit doctor information  
- Update stored medical records  

### ❌ Delete
- Delete patient records from the database  
- Remove or cancel appointment entries  
- Clean up incorrect or outdated records  

All CRUD operations are executed on the **MySQL relational database**.  
Django serves as the **application layer**, translating user actions from web forms into database queries and ensuring data consistency.

## 🔐 Data Security and Access Control

To protect sensitive information, certain **create, update, and delete operations** are restricted to authorized administrative users only.  
This role-based restriction helps maintain **data integrity, privacy, and security** within the MySQL database.
